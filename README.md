# DSP48A1 Design using Verilog

## Overview
This project implements the **DSP48A1** slice — a fundamental building block used in Xilinx FPGAs for digital signal processing (DSP) tasks — using **Verilog HDL**.  
It replicates the core arithmetic and logical functionality of the DSP48A1 block, including **multiplication**, **addition**, **accumulation**, and **control signal management**.


## Features
- Verilog-based modular implementation of DSP48A1 architecture  
- Supports:
  - Multiplication and addition
  - Accumulate mode
  - Pipeline registers for high performance
- Control signals to manage arithmetic and logic flow  
- Synthesizable and simulation-ready design  
- Well-documented testbench for verification

## Simulation & Verification
- **Simulator:** ModelSim / QuestaSim  
- **Testbench:** Exhaustively verifies:
  - Arithmetic correctness (multiply, add, accumulate)
  - Pipeline timing
  - Proper handling of control and reset signals  

**Expected Result:**  
The simulated waveforms confirm correct DSP48A1 functional behavior, matching reference timing and arithmetic operations.
